uv init project-name
uv venv # created env for env vairables
source .venv/bin/activate # activate them
uv add "mcp[cli]" # is important as is used to build fastMCP


uv run mcp dev server/weather.py # for MCP inspector

2 Transport Types (Built-In)
    - STDIO [client and server in the same machine]
    - SSE [client and server seperate, communicates with help of HTTP post request]

Tools -> Have computations [POST like]
Resources -> How to expose data to LLMs [GET like]
Prompts -> are resuable templates that help LLMs interact with server effectively

uv run mcp install server/weather.py # to install in calude destop app


{
  "mcpServers": {
    "weather": {
      "command": "/Users/macromrit/.local/bin/uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--with",
        "mcp[cli]",
        "mcp",
        "run",
        "/Users/macromrit/Desktop/mcp-test/server/weather.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}


to integrate directly with Command Line, add weather.json

uv add mcp-use # opensource way to connect any llms to any mcp server

uv add langchain-groq # for groq integration

to run python files do like this
  uv run server/client.py

can dockerize too
  - have the docker file properly configured
  - docker build -t mcp-server . # to build
  - docker run -p 8000:8000 mcp-server # to run
